Contains classes which are Unity specific, and only available on Unity builds.
The main classes to use are
[UnityTestInstructionExecutor](xref:Responsible.Unity.UnityTestInstructionExecutor),
which sets up a default test instruction executor for Unity,
and [TestOperationYieldInstruction&lt;T&gt;](xref:Responsible.Unity.TestOperationYieldInstruction`1),
which can be yielded from `[UnityTest]` methods.
