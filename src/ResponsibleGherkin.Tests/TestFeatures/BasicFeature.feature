Feature: Example feature
    This feature is just an example,
    and it has a multi-line description.

    Scenario: Example scenario
        Given the setup is "correct"
        * A list is contained in the input
        When the user does something
        Then the state should be updated correctly

    Scenario: Another scenario
        This is another example scenario,
        it also has a multi-line description.
        Given I know what I'm doing
        And I'm good at doing it
        When I code more
        Then I will produce working software!
        But it might not be useful
