Description:
  Generate Responsible test case stubs from Gherkin specifications.
  
  The configuration will be resolved by merging the following sources in descending priority order:
    * Comments in the Gherkin file
    * Manually specified configuration file
    * EditorConfig file resolved from the output path
    * Only if no manual configuration provided, the default configuration
  
  After merging the configurations, there must be a value specified for each configuration property. However, specifying a configuration value more than once in one source is an error. 
  
  The configuration format is fairly self-explanatory. Here is the default configuration:
  # responsible-flavor: Unity
  # responsible-indent: 4 spaces
  # responsible-namespace: MyNamespace
  # responsible-base-class: MyTestBase
  # responsible-executor: Executor
  
  The properties are
    * flavor: Unity, NUnit, Xunit (case insensitive)
    * indent: e.g. '1 tab', '4 spaces', '1 space'
    * namespace: the namespace for the generated code
    * base-class: base class for generated test classes
    * executor: property (or field) name in the base class, containing a TestInstructionExecutor

Usage:
  responsible-gherkin <input> [<output>] [options]

Arguments:
  <input>   Input feature file to generate code from
  <output>  Directory to write content into [default: .]

  -f, --force                      Overwrite output file, even if it already exists [default: False]
  --version                        Show version information
  -?, -h, --help                   Show help and usage information
