*Responsible* helps you write maintainable high level asynchronous tests in C#:
* Get highly readable and informative output on test failures and timeouts
* Write declarative, composable, and reusable test code

Additionally, in [Unity](https://unity.com/):
* Observe test execution progress while they are running in the Editor
* Stop worrying about a specific long-standing [Unity bug](https://issuetracker.unity3d.com/issues/unitytests-do-not-fail-when-nested-coroutines-throws-an-exception)
