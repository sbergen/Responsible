# Responsible Sample Project

This is a quick-and-dirty, but somewhat realistic sample project
that serves only the purpose of demonstrating how to set up
system-level tests using Responsible.

It's the simplest possible game I came up with in a handful of minutes,
and does not represent best practices of the game internals.

Instructions for playing: try to press space when the square is as close to the center as possible.
